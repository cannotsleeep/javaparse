[[breaking_715_indices_deprecations]]
==== Indices deprecations

[[deprecate-6x-indices]]
.Indices created in Elasticsearch 6.x and earlier versions are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 8.x, {es} will only read indices created in version 7.0 or above. An 8.x node
will not start in the presence of indices created in 6.x or earlier versions of
{es}.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading to an 8.x version, reindex any index created in 6.x or earlier
versions with {es} 7.x. If you no longer need the index, delete it instead.
You can use the get index API to check the {es} version in which an index
was created.

[[deprecate-simpleifs]]
.The `simpleifs` index store type is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `simplefs` value for the {ref}/index-modules-store.html[`index.store.type`]
index setting is now deprecated. Use the `niofs` value for superior or
equivalent performance instead.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the `simpleifs` store type in
new indices or index templates. Reindex any index using `simplefs` into one with
another store type.

[[breaking_715_security_deprecations]]
==== Security deprecations

[[deprecate-accept_default_password]]
.The `accept_default_password` setting is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 6.0, we deprecated the `accept_default_password` cluster setting. We removed
support for default passwords in 6.0 but did not remove the setting for
backwards compatibility. In 8.0, we will remove the setting.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the setting.
====

[[deprecate-native-role-cache-settings]]
.Native role cache settings are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 5.2, we deprecated the following cluster settings:

* `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size`
* `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl`

These native role cache settings have been unused since 5.2, but we did not
remove the settings for backwards compatibility. In 8.0, we will remove the
settings.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the settings.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_715_settings_deprecations]]
==== Settings deprecations

[[deprecate-fractional-byte-settings]]
.Fractional byte size values are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 6.2, we deprecated support for fractional byte size values, such as `23.5pb`,
in:

* Cluster settings
* Index settings
* Cluster state metadata, such as an {ilm-init} policy, that support byte size
values

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of fractional byte size values in
your configurations. Update any existing configurations to use whole values.
